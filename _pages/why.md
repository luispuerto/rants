Well, the question is... **WHY NOT?**
{: .text-center style="font-size: 1.5em"}

This is a small blog where I want to rant about things I think they aren't right, or fair, or working properly, for one reason or another. I guess that the main target of my complains are going to be thing here in Finland :finland:, where I currently live, but also all over the World :earth_africa::earth_asia::earth_americas: when I travel and of course my native Spain :es:. 

The main purpose is to vent the frustration, and the anger, I feel when I come across those thing in my normal life and I can't do anything for changing them. 

A secondary purpose of this blog is to give feedback. Feedback is sometimes the only tool we have to fix and improve things that are out of our control.
