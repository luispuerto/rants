I really don't want to continue talking about Apple. I assure you that this is not a blog focused in Apple problems, bugs and so. Yeah, the last four post —yes four counting this one— have been about Apple, but I can assure you that I'm really an Apple happy customer and probably not going to get out of their ecosystem because I really feel comfortable on it. 

Perhaps for that reason I'm pretty much pissed when I see things not working as I expect. Usually you complain more about the things you like and love more, or at least you are able to see easily their failures. 

My main complain here is that Apple has lately tried to put on customers the weight of proof that there is a problem in the system or gadget they are using. I understand that they should be totally sure that there is a problem, but instead of asking for what is the setup  and more info about the problem, so they can reproduce, they want you to do tests. This is really annoying at least in my case, because when I contact Apple I go with the _homework done_. In other words, I've already done my tests, investigate and check info about the issue, and pretty much I have a clear idea that most probably is a problem in their side. When they ask me to run again the test, they are making me to lose my time, and it's incredible annoying when you already has lost your time figure out what the problem is. And it's even more annoying when you know you aren't the only one reporting the problem, so pretty much, it's not going to be a problem on your side. 

As I complained before, now Apple has the bad habit of feed you canned and scripted responses from their customer support means, if you are lucky and you can contact them. As you can see [here][]. 

Not really, I don't need to do more test. What I want you if you fix the issue ASAP, so I can continue enjoying your products. 

Thanks!
