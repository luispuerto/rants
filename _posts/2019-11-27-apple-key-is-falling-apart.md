Hey ï£¿ Apple!!! 

It's me â€”againâ€” your loyal customer for more than 10 years.[^1] Again, and like the last time, I really didn't expect to be here â€”once moreâ€” complaining about you so soon. 

What has happened now is, one of the keys of my keyboard is staring to show signs of wear after less than 6 **_freaking_** months of normal use. I promise you that I'm not novelist or journalist or someone that spend their entire time in from the keyboard writing and writing and writing and writing... Probably, my use of the keyboard, is much less than the expected average use of a machine like this. 

It's really disappointing that something like this happens to a product with a hefty price tag. Yeah, one has to be honest, the product is good, but the price tag is really high. One, usually, close their eyes and just buy it because quality is usually top of the shelve... but I wouldn't say this in this case, or at least when we talk about this specific key. 

To make things worse, when I've contacted the ï£¿ Apple's customer support their reaction wasn't quite the expected one. Quality in customer support seems to be something that has decreased too on ï£¿ Apple side lately. Since I live in a non-English-native-speaking country â€”Finlandâ€”Â I try to contact ï£¿ Apple using the chat on the American site. It's much more convenient than trying to figure out what an automatic machine is trying to tell me in Finnish. Yeah, ï£¿ Apple site and customer service in Finland are only in Finnish[^5]. 

After I fed then with the details of the problem â€”I sent then a photo of the offending key and the serial number of my machine, so they could see it's really newâ€” they were telling me that perhaps _there's a cost associated with the repair_. **WHAT?** because _perhaps it was due to liquid_. **EXCUSE ME?** When I asked what they were talking about they told me that they were just informing me that could be a possibility. In other words, they were reading it from a script, instead of really thinking and take care of the case at hand[^2]. To what I replied that why didn't they focus on my specific case since this one clearly has nothing to do with water damage since the keyboard is working pretty well, that I'm an ï£¿ AppleCare customer and that the computer has less than **6 freaking months**. It isn't justify at all this wearing off! **The computer is practically new!** My old MBP 2011 didn't have any sign of wear on the keys after 5 or 6 years using it.

After all this fuzzy talking and non-sense, they suggested â€”in a really subtle wayâ€”Â that I have to turn the computer in for repair. The problem I have with that is, I live quite in a _remote area_[^3], so for me turning my computer in it's a mayor disruption of my work. Usually involve more than one week, or at least one week, to send the computer to perhaps Helsinki,[^6] repair and send it back to me. So since, it isn't a vital repair, the keyboard is working â€”why it shouldn'tâ€” and I can live with it for a while â€”although I'm pretty pissed about itâ€”Â I don't want to send the computer over the mail for the repair. Besides, at some point on the next two months or so, I'll need to go to Helsinki, where perhaps I'll can repair it. 

When I point this out to them and they try to find me a place where I can turn the computer in for repair in Helsinki. They ask the zip code of Helsinki, which for me is quite puzzling question since Helsinki is a million people city and it has hundreds of zip codes. I ask if they mean a zip code of the place where I'm going to stay or go in the city. So, I look on Google Maps some address on the center of Helsinki and fed to them the zip code, to which they return me re results to some place in **Arizona**. :thinking:. I really don't know where they think Helsinki is, but I'm sure it's really far away from Arizona.[^7] When we clear the confusion and they finally give me results for the correct Helsinki, Finland :finland:, they tried to arrange me an appointment with one of the stores. Problem was, and still is, I told then beforehand that I didn't know when I was going, so I just wanted to know how to proceed when I'll have things more clear. They don't listen, just read from the script. 

Since I got the possible places for the repair I decided to get in contact with one of them so I can know what is their take on the issue. When I called the first one, they told me they don't have a repair service any more â€”they just sellâ€” since there is an official repair store on town. Ok... So I decided to get in contact my email with this official repair store, which was among the results ï£¿ Apple support gave to me. 

Their reply was more or less the following: _The wearing down of a keyboard cap is not a valid reason to service it under warranty by Apple rules._ Sorry, what? _But we can replace the whole top case if there's any issues with the keyboard like pressing a key makes a double letter or nothing at all. Even if this is intermittent and doesn't always happen._ They also state that it takes like _4 working days to get it fixed. We need to order the parts from Apple warehouse and can't do it in advance._

In other words, it's going to be probably much more than a week to get it fixed and perhaps even two weeks. :angry: And at that time is when I decided to write this post. 

So the ï£¿ Apple idea of repair something, be really environmental friendly and take care of their customers is: tear apart a whole computer[^4] and keep a customer without computer for almost two weeks for something that could be possible to be fixed in less than 5 minutes without opening the computer. Not to mention the waste of materials and energy that suppose changing a whole piece what is working totally fine. 

Very good! :clap:. 

PS1/ In the course of writing this post, one of the keys of my keyboard got stuck... The "U". So, yeah! Seems that this generation keyboard also has some problems. I guess that my destiny is to switch keyboards at some point in the near future :unamused:.


[^1]: Yeah... I know that for you a customer of just 10 years is nothing, since you have a 50 years history and some of your customers are as old as that. 
[^2]: That's another thing. On my last two interactions with ï£¿ Apple Customer Support it looked like they were reading from a script. I really thought that ï£¿ Apple was the company of "think different", not of don't think just read it from a script. 
[^3]: No, I don't live in a remote area. But it's not the first time I've been told that. I live in Joensuu, which is 400 km away from Helsinki in the Eastern part of Finland. There is a lot of life here and Joensuu is a 60K people city. 
[^4]: To replace the whole keyboard you need to open the computer in full and remove everything until you are able to reach the keyboard. For that reason the keyboard and the mouse pad should be one of the most sturdy components in the computer. They are vital, you use then a lot, and they are difficult to change. 
[^5]: This is pretty awful problem that ï£¿ Apple has and as international company is pretty jaw-drooping. Each Apple site is only in the local language and they usually only offer support in the local language. I don't understand why they don't offer service in the local language plus English everywhere. International company with an international vision ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³. Not only Apple has this problem, but a lot of other companies have it, like Google or Microsoft. Everyday is more common that because you live in a country you don't need to speak the main language of said country. Even more we are talking about he European Union :european_union:, where Europeans can move freely to live and work. 
[^6]: Actually the closes place I think it's Lappeenranta, but it's not that much of a difference. 
[^7]: It's not the first time that talking to a US customer service they don't know where Helsinki is, or what is the geography of the Nordics. I'll probably tell about that in a future post, but I can advance that the most mind-blowing about that is, it was the customer support a European and Nordic airline.
